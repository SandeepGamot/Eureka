PigeonHole_Principle:
    Simply it states that with 'n' objects to put into 'm' places, where n>m, then one of the place must have more than one elements.
    Inversely if n<m and all places must be filled than it is guaranteed that one or more element will be in more than one place.

    This principle can be used to check uniqueness among other things(I'll add them when I discover).
    For Eg: If you have to check that a string has all unique characters(a-z).
        then u can check whether the string has length more than 26 as a filter condition before running the algorithm.
        If the string is more than 26 chars long then it is guaranteed that it will not be unique.

        /* Assumes only letters a through z. */
        	public static boolean isUniqueChars(String str) {
                    if (str.length() > 26)
                    {
                     // Only 26 characters
                        return false;
                    }
        		}
