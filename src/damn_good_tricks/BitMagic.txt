* XOR ing to remove pairs
        A basic truth about XOR is that if u XOR 2 numbers the result is always 0.
        So if the problem requires to remove pairs or find a number that is not in a pair.
        You can have an int field that serves as the memory to store the bits.
        And for every num in array or stream just XOR them with the int field this will remove all the numbers that are in pairs,
        this works when there is only one number to find or addition of all the single numbers. Not to point out the location.
        Basically anything to do with pairs in O(1) space complexity this might be one of the tricks to try.
