This trick is useful to check the uniqueness of a random collection(Strings,arrays) of elements from a set(i.e a collection with unique elements)
with a unique associated value for each element.
For Eg: Alphabets each elements are distinct and have a unique ASCII value associated.

Now to use an int field as boolean array, we need an int field let's call it checker.

Now choose one of the element(usually the first) within the set as a default.
 In case of alphabets we use 'a' now for each element from the input subtract the default value from it and store it into a value.
 For Eg: "hello" for each char we sub 'a' from it, i.e 'h'-'a'.
 This gives a unique value for every char and same value for same char.

 Now right shift 1 with the obtained value and check it against the checker field by logically AND ing them to check if it is greater than 0
 if it's > 0 then this char was already encountered and hence return false

 else Logically OR the 1<<value with the checker element.

 This will register 1 in the binary.
